## A basic summary project to test knowledge of following concepts:
+ State management
+ Lifting State
+ Stateless and Statefull components
+ Basic React workflow
+ React reactivity
+ Props
+ Components
+ Dynamic data rendering

From here I'll move on to portals, refs, fragments and forward with hooks: useEffect, useReducer, useRef, useContext.
